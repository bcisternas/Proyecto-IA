abstract = {Multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly applied for surveillance tasks such as disaster management and environmental monitoring. Due to limited battery capacity and bounded wireless communication, small-scale UAVs pose fundamental challenges for achieving persistence. We propose an offline path planning algorithm that ensures that the UAVs can always reach the base station to replace their batteries and that each UAV is always connected with the base station via a single or multi-hop link. We focus on heterogeneous UAVs with different flight times. The single base station scenario is compared with several extensions for multiple base stations based on the maximum time a sensing location has not been visited.},

ABSTRACT = {Control of autonomous vehicles for applications such as surveillance, search, and exploration has been a topic of great interest over the past two decades. In particular, there has been a rising interest in control of multiple vehicles for reasons such as increase in system reliability, robustness, and efficiency, with a possible reduction in cost. The exploration problem is NP hard even for a single vehicle/agent, and the use of multiple vehicles brings forth a whole new suite of problems associated with communication and cooperation between vehicles. The persistent surveillance problem differs from exploration since it involves continuous/repeated coverage of the target space, minimizing time between re-visits. The use of aerial vehicles demands consideration of vehicle dynamic and endurance constraints as well. Another aspect of the problem that has been investigated to a lesser extent is the design of the vehicles for particular missions. The intent of this paper is to thoroughly review the persistent surveillance problem, with particular focus on multiple Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), and present some of our own work in this area. We investigate the different aspects of the problem and slightly digress into techniques that have been applied to exploration and coverage, but a comprehensive survey of all the work in multiple vehicle control for search, exploration, and coverage is beyond the scope of this paper.},

abstract = {We address the problem of achieving persistent surveillance over an environment by using energy-constrained unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are supported by unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) serving as mobile charging stations. Specifically we plan the trajectories of all vehicles and the charging schedule of UAVs to minimize the long-term maximum age, where age is defined as the time between two consecutive visits to regions of interest in a partitioned environment. We introduce a scalable planning strategy based on 1) creating UAV-UGV teams, 2) decomposing the environment into optimal partitions that can be covered by any of the teams in a single fuel cycle, 3) uniformly distributing the teams over a cyclic path traversing those partitions, and 4) having the UAVs in each team cover their current partition and be transported to the next partition while being recharged by the UGV. We show some results related to the safety and performance of the proposed strategy.}
